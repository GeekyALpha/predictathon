**README for Predictathon Deepfake Detection**

This document provides an overview of the Deepfake Detection AI model developed for Predictathon 2025. The model is designed to accurately classify real and fake images using CNN-based feature extraction and deep learning models.

---

**Project Overview**

This project aims to build a highly accurate deepfake detection model that generalizes well to unseen images. The model is trained on real and fake images with their corresponding deepfake probability scores, enabling it to distinguish between authentic and manipulated media.

**Dataset & Preprocessing**

**Dataset Used:**
- CIFake Dataset (Deepfake & Real Images)
- JSON file containing deepfake detection scores  

**Preprocessing Steps:**
- Resized images to 224x224 pixels  
- Normalized using mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]  
- Data Augmentation (Flip, Rotation, Brightness Adjustments)  
- Loaded images using PyTorchâ€™s DataLoader

**Deployment**

**Backend (Flask API)**

We deployed the trained model using Flask API on Google Colab, exposing it through ngrok for external access.

**Run API in Google Colab:**
```
!python api/app.py &
from pyngrok import ngrok
public_url = ngrok.connect(5000)
print("API is running at:", public_url)
```

**Frontend (Streamlit)**

A Streamlit Web App was built for user interaction, allowing image uploads and real-time deepfake detection.

**Run Streamlit App Locally:**
```
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

---

**API Usage**

**Endpoint:**  
```
POST https://<your-ngrok-url>/predict
```

**Request Format:**
```
{
  "file": "image.jpg"
}
```

**Sample Response:**
```
{
  "label": "FAKE",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```
